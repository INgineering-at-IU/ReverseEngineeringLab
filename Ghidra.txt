FOR MAC USERS



1. What Ghidra is (in one sentence)

Ghidra is a free program from the NSA that lets you take apart compiled programs (like .exe files) to see what they do. It’s a reverse-engineering toolbox. 
Wikipedia

To run it, you need two main things:

Java (JDK) – the “engine” Ghidra runs on

Ghidra itself – the reverse-engineering app

2. Install Java (JDK)

Ghidra requires a 64-bit Java Development Kit (JDK)—currently JDK 21 is what the official docs recommend. 
GitHub

Step 2.1: Download JDK

Open your browser and search for: Temurin JDK 21 (or go to the official Adoptium/Oracle JDK 21 page).

Download the Windows x64 .msi installer for JDK 21.

If there’s a choice between JRE and JDK: pick JDK.

Step 2.2: Run the installer

Double-click the jdk-21-...-windows-x64.msi file.

Click Next through the wizard.

Keep the defaults unless you know what you’re doing.

Make sure any option like “Set JAVA_HOME” or “Add to PATH” is enabled if offered.

Finish the install.

You now have Java; Ghidra will refuse to run without this.

3. Download Ghidra

The official Ghidra site is: 
ghidra.net

Website: https://ghidra-sre.org → this links you to the official GitHub releases.

Step 3.1: Go to the releases page

On the Ghidra website, click the link to GitHub Releases or similar.

You’ll end up on a page like:
https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/ghidra/releases 
GitHub

Step 3.2: Choose the correct file

On the latest release:

Look for a file named like:

ghidra_11.4.2_PUBLIC_20250827.zip


(The version and date will change over time.)

Important:

You want the big .zip file with PUBLIC in the name.

Do NOT download the ones called “Source code (zip)” or “Source code (tar.gz)” – those are for developers, not for running Ghidra. 
GitHub

Click that .zip file and let it download.

4. “Installing” Ghidra (really just unzipping)

Ghidra doesn’t have a classic installer; you unzip it and run it.

Step 4.1: Choose a permanent folder

Pick a place you want Ghidra to live, for example:

C:\Tools\Ghidra\

or C:\Users\<yourname>\Programs\Ghidra\

Try not to keep it in Downloads forever, because you’ll forget where it is.

Step 4.2: Extract the ZIP

Right-click the Ghidra .zip file you downloaded.

Click “Extract All…”.

Choose your folder (e.g. C:\Tools\Ghidra\).

Click Extract.

After extraction you’ll have a folder like:

C:\Tools\Ghidra\ghidra_11.4.2_PUBLIC\


Inside that folder you’ll see things like:

ghidraRun.bat

Ghidra\ (subfolder)

docs\

support\

etc.

That’s the whole “installation.” No registry magic or anything.

5. Running Ghidra for the first time
Step 5.1: Start it the easy way (double-click)

Go into your Ghidra folder:

C:\Tools\Ghidra\ghidra_11.4.2_PUBLIC\

Double-click ghidraRun.bat.

If Java is installed correctly, a command window may flash and then Ghidra’s GUI will appear after a bit.

If nothing happens or you get a Java error, we’ll fix that in a second.

Step 5.2: If you want a Desktop shortcut (recommended)

Right-click ghidraRun.bat.

Click Send to → Desktop (create shortcut).

On your desktop, rename the shortcut to “Ghidra”.

Now you can just double-click the shortcut like any other app.

6. First-time setup inside Ghidra

When Ghidra opens the first time, it’ll walk you through some basic stuff:

6.1: Accept the license

A window will pop up with a license.

Scroll down and click Accept.

6.2: Choose a Ghidra projects folder

This is where Ghidra will store all your reverse-engineering projects.

It might suggest a default path like
C:\Users\<you>\ghidra_projects.

You can accept that or browse to a folder you make, e.g.
C:\Users\<you>\Documents\GhidraProjects\.

Click OK.

You’ll then see the Project Manager window (a blank main window with a left panel for projects).

7. Creating your first project and opening a binary

This is the “hello world” of reverse engineering.

7.1: Make a new project

In the Project Manager, click File → New Project.

Choose Non-Shared Project (this means “just me, on this machine”).

Pick a project folder/name, e.g.:

Name: easyRE_lab

Click Finish.

Your new project appears in the left tree.

7.2: Import a file (the .exe you want to analyze)

In the Project Manager, choose File → Import File…

Browse to a binary:

For a lab, they might give you something like easyRE.exe or similar.

Select it and click Open.

You’ll see an Import dialog:

It’ll auto-detect the file type (e.g. PE (Portable Executable) for Windows .exe).

Usually you can just leave all the options alone at first.

Click OK.

The file will now show up under your project in the left panel.

7.3: Open the file in CodeBrowser

Double-click your imported file in the left panel.

Ghidra will ask if you want to Analyze it now.

Check “Analyze this” (it’s usually checked already) and click OK.

Ghidra will think for a bit; then you’ll see:

Central code view: disassembly and/or decompiled C-like code.

Left: symbol tree, functions, etc.

Top right: listing, decompiler window, etc.

Congrats, Ghidra is installed and you’re actually reverse-engineering something 🎉

8. Common problems & fixes (Windows beginner edition)
Problem 1: ghidraRun.bat opens a black window and closes instantly

Most likely:

Java/JDK isn’t installed
or

It’s installed but not 64-bit
or

Ghidra can’t find it in your PATH.

Fix:
Reinstall a 64-bit JDK 21, and make sure:

You choose the Windows x64 version.

Optionally, reinstall and in the JDK installer check “Set JAVA_HOME / Add to PATH” if it appears.

Problem 2: Ghidra complains about Java version

If you see a popup about “wrong Java version,” make sure you’re using a version Ghidra supports (currently JDK 21 is recommended). 
GitHub
+1

If you have multiple Javas installed (like JDK 8 + JDK 21), Ghidra might pick the wrong one; in that case you can:

Uninstall the older JDK/JRE via Add or Remove Programs,
or

Edit ghidraRun.bat to point explicitly at the right Java, but if you’re “no idea what I’m doing” level, uninstalling the old one is easier.

9. Very quick “what you’re looking at” once Ghidra is open

Just so the windows don’t feel totally alien:

Project Manager – where you manage different reverse-engineering projects and binaries.

CodeBrowser – the main window with:

Listing: assembly instructions (left).

Decompiler: C-like pseudocode (usually on the right) – this is what you’ll mostly read.

Symbol Tree: functions, labels, etc., on the left side.

Console/Log: messages from Ghidra at the bottom.

For a simple lab where you’re just learning to “navigate pseudo-C,” your instructor will usually have you:

Open the decompiler window.

Click different functions in the left tree.

Read the pseudocode and figure out what the program does or what the “password” is.
