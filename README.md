Reverse Engineering Lab: Intro to Ghidra & Pseudo-C Analysis

This introductory reverse-engineering lab is designed to teach students the basics of navigating Ghidra, exploring program structure, and interpreting decompiled pseudo-C code. The goal is to build confidence reading low-level representations of familiar constructs so students can begin understanding how compiled programs behave under the hood.

Participants will learn how to:

Import and analyze binaries in Ghidra

Navigate the CodeBrowser, symbol tree, functions window, and decompiler

Interpret pseudo-C output, including function signatures, control flow, and variable types

Recognize how common data types appear in compiled form

Students will encounter various C-style types typically generated by Ghidra during decompilation, such as:

unsigned int, unsigned char, unsigned long — representing non-negative integer values of different sizes

int32_t, uint64_t, uint8_t — fixed-width integer types that specify the exact number of bits

char* and string pointers — used when Ghidra identifies text data or null-terminated strings

size_t — a platform-dependent type commonly used for memory sizes and counts

bool / _Bool — Ghidra’s representation of boolean values

void* — a generic pointer when Ghidra cannot infer a more specific type

By the end of the lab, students should be comfortable tracing basic program logic, understanding how C structures map to machine instructions, and using Ghidra’s interface to explore binaries with confidence.
